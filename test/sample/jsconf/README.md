# JSConformance sample files

The JSConformance Linter pass is a port of Closure Compiler's
[JSConformance pass](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/JS-Conformance)
which checks JavaScript code based on a configurable policy.

This directory contains sample configurations and other files related to testing
of the port.

The conformance policies can be specified using the JSON form of the
Conformance protocol buffer described in the
[JSConformance docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Zx-p-GmgPIEig26dFV4Iy9u6wTOLem8o7ScaqT66lA/view)
